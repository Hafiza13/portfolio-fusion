# 🌐 Portfolio Fusion – Hafiza Bibi Nessa Allamammally

## 📘 Introduction

**Portfolio Fusion** is a multi-page website created as part of the **ISYS3004 – AI-Assisted Web Development** unit at **Curtin University**. This project showcases my ability to integrate **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with the critical use of **AI tools like ChatGPT** to design, develop, and refine interactive and accessible web experiences.

The portfolio includes five weekly challenges, each demonstrating a different skillset—from responsive layout and theming, to interactivity and data fetching—all styled consistently with global CSS and powered by clean JavaScript logic. In addition, I documented my use of AI tools, reflected on design decisions, and critically improved the codebase with a professional mindset.
