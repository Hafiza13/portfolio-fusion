      <h2>🌟 Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Hafiza. At Curtin University the Business Information Systems program allows me to explore the intersection of creativity, technology, and user experience.
        <br><br>
        My commitment to technology-based solutions meets my problem-solving capabilities as I continuously improve myself from my deep interest in solving actual operational problems.
        <br><br>
        In this portfolio you will find descriptions of completed tasks alongside my handling of difficult situations where I needed AI assistance to create sophisticated and creative solutions.
      </p>

      <h2>💼 Professional Profile</h2>
      <p>
        The process of developing digital experiences through innovation-based implementation methods shapes my professional working habits.
        <br><br>
        I integrate elements of analytical thinking with creative curiosity to build technology that delivers meaningful practical usefulness in all my work assignments.
        <br><br>
        My work experience includes working as an intern where I both assisted users and gained exposure to numerous IT projects.
